The given Terraform code deploys an Azure Web App with Windows operating system, using a Premium V3 P1V3 pricing plan with zone redundancy enabled. The web app is not publicly accessible and network injection is enabled. The web app is integrated with a virtual network called 'vnet1' and App Insight is enabled for logging and monitoring.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the resources created:

azurerm_application_insights: This resource creates an Application Insights instance that logs and monitors the web app. The application_type is set to 'web'.

azurerm_service_plan: This resource creates a service plan with the specified SKU and operating system. The service plan is associated with the resource group and location provided.

azurerm_windows_web_app: This resource creates a Windows web app with the specified name and location, and associates it with the previously created service plan. The web app is integrated with the 'vnet1' virtual network and App Insights is enabled. The minimum_tls_version is set to 1.2 and always_on is enabled. The app_settings block is used to pass the Application Insights instrumentation key to the web app.

azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting: This resource creates a diagnostic setting for the web app to enable AppServiceHTTPLogs, and configures retention policy for 7 days. It also links the web app to the Log Analytics workspace provided.

azurerm_private_endpoint: This resource creates a private endpoint for the web app, using the specified subnet and private DNS zone. The web app resource is connected to the private endpoint using a private service connection.

The variables used in this Terraform code are app_insight_name, resource_group, app_service_plan_name, app_service_sku_name, app_subnet_id, lgw_id, app_pep_name, app_pep_connection_name, and app_pep_dns_zone_id.

Before running this Terraform code, make sure to provide the correct values for these variables in the variables.tf file.

After running this Terraform code, a Windows web app with the specified configuration will be deployed along with a private endpoint, and logs will be sent to the configured Log Analytics workspace for monitoring and analysis.
