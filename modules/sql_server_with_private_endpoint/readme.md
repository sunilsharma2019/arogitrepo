The Terraform code above creates a private endpoint for an Azure SQL server with a private DNS zone. The code includes the following resources:

azurerm_mssql_server: This resource creates an Azure SQL Server instance with a system-assigned managed identity and disables public network access. The resource also sets the minimum TLS version and admin login credentials.

azurerm_network_interface: This resource creates a network interface for the private endpoint. The network interface includes an IP configuration with a dynamic private IP address allocation.

azurerm_private_endpoint: This resource creates a private endpoint for the Azure SQL Server instance. The private endpoint is associated with a subnet and a network interface. It also includes a private service connection to the SQL Server instance and a link to the private DNS zone.

The private DNS zone is not created using Terraform in this code. It is assumed that the DNS zone already exists and is identified by its resource ID in the private_dns_zone_id parameter.

Note that some variables are used in the code to allow for parameterization and reuse. These variables include the name of the SQL server, the name of the network interface, the name of the private endpoint, the subnet ID, the admin login credentials, and the private DNS zone ID.
